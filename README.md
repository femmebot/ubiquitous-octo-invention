#myUSCIS Research Strategy

##Overview
User research should be a core aspect of the myUSCIS project and different forms of research should occur at various frequencies. Below are the recommended activities that the design team should regularly be performing.
##Analytics Reporting
_Frequency - Weekly_

Every week, a member of the team should provide a read out of the web analytics that are tracking user activity on the naturalization application. This read out should attempt to point out areas of concern and pain points that are being communicated by metrics like form abandonment and the time it takes a user to complete specific form fields.

_Dependencies_
* Naturalization application form is live and activity being used by users.
* The form has been properly coded for analytic tracking
* The team has defined the metrics and funnels they want to track and report out on
* A team member familiar enough with web analytics to set up the tracking and reporting

##Tactical Usability Testing
_Frequency - Once a Month_

The work of the team should be tested early and often. To best meet this goal, once a month the team should take what they've been working on and put it in front of end users. Using existing relationships at field offices around the country, the team should have easy access to potential participants by intercepting people who just successfully past their naturalization interview. These tactical usability test sessions should last between 15-30 minutes and focus specifically on the problems the team have been recently trying to solve.

_Incentives_

If possible, reimburse participants for their time with an honorarium of $25-$50 dollars, depending on the length of the sessions.

##Full Experience Usability Testing
_Frequency - Once a Quarter_

Once a quarter, it's recommended that the design team performs an end-to-end evaluation of the naturalization application. This should be a focused effort where others work efforts are limited or paused and it should involve the entire team in some capacity. Using the existing at field offices around the country, actively recruit participants who recently completed their naturalization interview in the last six months to come in and go through the application from start to finish. These sessions should last between 45-60 minutes.

_Incentives_

If possible, reimburse participants for their time with an honorarium of $50-$75 dollars, depending on the length of the sessions.

_Dependencies_
* 2 weeks prep time for research plan and recruiting
* Recruiting method to contact recent naturalized citizens
* Remote viewing technology for wide team to observe testing sessions
* Remote "usability lab" equipment to use at local immigration offices

##Focused User Research
_Frequency - Every Six Months_

While people's end goals hardly ever change, the way people go about accomplishing their goals do. Twice a year, a subset of the design team should spend a few weeks meeting with potential users and exploring their world and mindset in terms of the naturalization application. The participant pool should be a mix of those that haven't filled out the application and those that have recently completed it.

_Incentives_

If possible, reimburse participants for their time with an honorarium of $50-$75 dollars, depending on the length of the sessions.

##Reporting Methods
Each form of research is going to take a different form of reporting so the team and stakeholders can understand what was done and what the team learned. The importance of reporting out the research findings is to remind everyone not only the value of research, but the value of including users in the overall design process.

###Analytics
The weekly report of the web analytics should take two forms. An email sent out to the team highlighting any points of interest and areas that might need to be considered for further research. Since email can easily be missed, a quick 5 minute report out should be given to the team during one of the daily stand ups early in the week. E.g. Create report on Monday, report to the team on Tuesday.

###Usability Tests
The report for the usability tests the team will conduct depends on the focus of the study.
####Tactical Usability Test Reporting
Since tactical usability tests focus on a single task or UI component, the report should reflect this focus. Each task or UI component that was focused on should be reported on based on user interactions and comments. A severity rating, based on NNGroup's rating scale (https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/), should be used to help the team prioritize the work necessary to correct the issues.

####Full Experience Test Reporting
End-to-end testing differs from tactical testing since the team is trying to assess the entire experience of a product. The report for this form of testing should reflect that by focusing on the overall themes that come out of the testing. Each theme should be given a title and the evidence for why that theme is present should be detailed out. A recommendation for how to address the problems that theme represents should be made with the same severity scale from NNGroup.

###User Research
The findings coming out of user research should follow the same manner as the Full Experience Test Reporting. When the team has collected all the data, look for the patterns that stand out around user goals, needs, pains, joys, and missed opportunities. These patterns will turn into the themes that should guide the next phase of design efforts.
